N Please Read |N|This guide assumes you are 80, but can completed at 77, it is just much harder to solo the elite at the end. You must do the entire quest chain to unlock the faction mob. After you have defeated the elite lich and selected your allegiance, then getting to exalted requires doing the dailies for that faction. To switch factions, just re-engage the elite lich, choose the other faction to kill and accept the quest for the new faction, rinse, repeat.|
